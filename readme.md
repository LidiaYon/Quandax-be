Donkey arkey...

clone it then do npm install
then do npm run dev.

you will need to have your .env ready. mine is like this

PORT=8089
API_BASE='/api/v1/'
APP_NAME=QUANZ
JWT_SECRET=donkeyarkey
TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN_HOUR=24h
FORGOT_PWD_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN_HOUR=1h
ENVIRONMENT=development
DB_URL=mongodb+srv://kmsium:Ap2f4rBzXxSjx17x@cluster0.odixx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0


i think you can ue everything as is but you can create your own mongodb too.

we can go through the app on a call during day time. do you want me to finish it or you can try somethings following the same structure?

i can do the Front end.
